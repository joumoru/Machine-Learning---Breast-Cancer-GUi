# Machine-Learning---Breast-Cancer-GUi
This Java project employs the Weka machine learning library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows for the classification of breast cancer cases. Using a dataset of breast cancer instances, the Naive Bayes classifier is trained to predict whether a new instance is likely to be a cancer case or not.
